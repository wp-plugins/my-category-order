== Installation ==

1. Copy plugin contents to /wp-content/plugins/my-category-order
2. Activate the My Category Order plugin on the Plugins menu
3. Go to the "My Category Order" tab under Manage and specify your desired order for post categories
   
4. If you are using widgets then replace the standard "Category" widget with the "My Category Order" widget. That's it.

5. If you aren't using widgets, modify sidebar template to use correct orderby value:
	wp_list_categories('orderby=order&title_li=');

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why modify a core file? =

The way categories can be ordered is hardcoded at a very low level. Adding an ordering option at that level
makes it easy for people to modify their themes and helps overall compatibility.
